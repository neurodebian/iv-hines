// =======================================================================

//                     <IV-Win/Event.h>
//
//  MS-Windows implementation of the InterViews Event classes.  
//
//  The flow of control is significantly different from X11 in MS-Windows.
//  Messages come from a callback rather than read from a socket, and the
//  messages are distributed to a WindowRep object.  Therefore, the events
//  are actually created by a WindowRep-based object which then turns
//  around and calls EventRep::handleCallback(), which occurs as a result
//  of calling Event::handle() (which is what Session::run() does).  This
//  should support modified event loops that programmers wrote rather
//  than using Session::run().  
//
//  WARNING - Any assumption that the event is valid after a Session::read()
//            is guaranteed to be incorrect since the event is actually
//            filled out in the callback.  The only safe thing to do after
//            a read is eventually call Event::handle()!!
//
//
//  The EventRep stores the type and button information directly as the
//  values used by the Event class.  The modifier_ field contains keycode
//  information... MK_? if mouse event and VK_? if keyboard event.  All
//  information is stashed directly in the EventRep with no translation
//  unless the information is asked for through the Event class.  This is
//  to facilitate rapid creation since a large number of these will be
//  created (especially mouse motion events).
